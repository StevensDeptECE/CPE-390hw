Hello!
This is your first homework.  All of the assembler assignments will be like this.
to build the homework use the make command

make

There are 3 targets in the Makefile.  The first will by default build everything.

make hw1setup

will build just the first target, which uses C++.  You can then look at the generated assembly language and hopefully learn what you need to do.

Your job is to write the file add.s
If you correctly write assembler code to add two 32 bit numbers, then your program when built should print the number 5.

Once you get that done, you must submit your code.  Do this with the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m"your comment here, like I just submitted hw1 yay me!"
git push

the first command, git add assumes that you are in the directory hw1.

If you have any problems pushing your homework, please contact your TA.
Good luck!
