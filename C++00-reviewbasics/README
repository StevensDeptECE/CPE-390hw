This homework is for C++ practice.  If you never learned it that well,
or just forgot it since freshman year, this is your chance to master
C++ before you start writing assembler.

1. The program first.cc is partially written.  Complete it to contain the following loops:
  a. count from 1 to 10 printing out each number separated by a space.  Then print a newline.
  b. count from 10 down to 0.
  c. count from 0 to 10 by twos.
  d. start with 1 and double each time until 1024
  
The output of first.c should look like this:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 2 4 6 8 10
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024

2. Write a program computing sums, each in a function.
The framework of the program is there

  a. Sum the numbers from 1 to n using the function sum.
  b. Sum the reciprocals of numbers 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n
  c. Sum the reciprocals as in part b, but in the reverse order:
     1/n + 1/(n-1) + ... 1/1

3. Floating Point
  a. Read in two numbers a and b from stdin (given), then compute c, the hypotenuse
  b. compute and print the area of the triangle

Example output:
3 4
The hypotenuse is: 5
The area is: 6

4. Roundoff Error
  a. Write a loop to print out numbers from 0.0 to 10.0 stepping by 0.1 using single precision (float).
  b. Do the same thing but with double precision.
